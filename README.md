# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  lack of error handling for invalid input.  The provided `bug.js` file shows a route that's vulnerable to crashing if an invalid user ID is provided.  `bugSolution.js` presents a corrected version with proper error handling.

**Problem:** The original code attempts to parse a user ID from the request parameters as an integer and uses it to find a user in an array. However, it fails to check if the parsed ID is actually a number or if the user exists, which could lead to errors (like `NaN` comparison) or unexpected behavior (like returning `undefined`).

**Solution:** The corrected code includes checks to ensure the user ID is a number and that the user exists before accessing or using user data.  If a user with a matching ID is not found or the ID is invalid, an appropriate error response is sent.
